# Capstone Project 4: Use A Public API
A project made while doing "[The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)" Udemy Course. 

It contains a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a public API ([Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)), EJS as the templating language and Bootstrap as the CSS Framework. It uses GET requests to choose a random anime character from the Anime written by the user.
Being a Node.js project, to be run the project requires a server. You can run it locally with NPM in Visual Studio Code using the terminal. 


Make sure you have node.js installed, open the project's folder with Visual Studio code. Launch its terminal and write the following:

2. npm i
3. node index.js
